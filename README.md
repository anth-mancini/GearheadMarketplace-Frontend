We'll use Heroku at the end of it all to deploy the main branch of the PHP app and FastAPI

FastAPI: https://medium.com/fastapi-tutorials/deploying-fastapi-to-heroku-cd00bdcf3be4

PHP: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-php 

How to run this localally: 

Get a AMP for whatever system you're using and follow the steps for integrating this into phpStorm: 

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/installing-an-amp-package.html

Recommend getting phpStorm and link your amp. You can get the deluxe, if you use your windsor account.

Before you start your MAMP server, point the root dir to the dir of the PHP app.

Set the ports to 80 for apache/php and 3306 for the mySQL DB

For me the root dir is something like: Users ▹ felixi ▹ PhpstormProjects ▹ GearheadMarketplace-Frontend
